# Foothold?
Foothold? is a mod for PEAK that visualizes standable ground. This is meant to be used when you're unsure if a part of the wall will work as a foothold or not.

## Usage
By default, it continuously shows markers in a 10x10x10 cube around you.  A white ball means the ground is standable and a red ball means the ground is not standable. No balls will appear on ground that is less than a 30 degree slope for performance reasons, as it's obvious enough on its own. (And the red ones are more important anyway)

There are config options to change it to only activate on keypress (default F key).

## Configuration
You can configure the activation key in the configuration file at BepInEx/config/Foothold.cfg. It will be autogenerated by BepInEx the first time you run the mod. You can also enable "Fade Away" or "Toggle" mode in the config.
