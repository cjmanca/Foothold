To assemble the Thunderstore package, create a folder called Tzebruh-Foothold and include these files:

Foothold.dll - From <repo>/bin/Debug/netstandard2.1/
Assets/ - From <repo>/thunderstore/

Then put that folder into a zip file along with these files:

icon.png - From <repo>/thunderstore/
LICENSE - From <repo>/
manifest.json - From <repo>/thunderstore/
README.md - From <repo>/

<repo>/thunderstore/*.zip is gitignored, so the zip file should be <repo>/thunderstore/Tzebruh-Foothold-<version>.zip
<repo>/thunderstore/Tzebruh-Foothold is also gitignored so you can assemble the folder there

If you compile a new version of the assetbundle, copy:
foothold - from <repo>/foothold assetbundle project/Assets/ModBundles/ - to <repo>/thunderstore/Assets/
